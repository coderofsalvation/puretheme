Puretheme, a design template for puredata (vanilla)

![](https://github.com/coderofsalvation/puretheme/blob/master/puretheme-guide.gif)

## Usage 

* download `puretheme.pd` and put it in your project folder
* create the `puretheme` object
* click it, and copy/paste the gui items into your parent window
* profit!

## Why 

* speed up nice-looking puredata gui's
* create meta-editors (node-editors built in puredata)
* easily create abstractions with builtin paramview (like touchdesigner/blender/sunvox)

## How it works

This is just creative usage of the canvas-object as [described in detail here](https://github.com/megalon/pd-gui-examples)
